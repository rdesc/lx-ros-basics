Let's use [rqt\\_graph](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph) which shows the nodes and topics currently running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using rqt\\_graph\n",
    "\n",

    "If you place your mouse over /turtle1/command\\_velocity it will highlight the ROS nodes (here blue and green) and topics (here red). As you can see, the turtlesim\\_node and the turtle\\_teleop\\_key nodes are communicating on the topic named /turtle1/command\\_velocity.\n",

    "    rostopic type   print topic type\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "rostopic \n",
    "bw    echo  find  hz    info  list  pub   type \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use some of these topic sub-commands to examine turtlesim.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using rostopic echo\n",
    "\n",
    "rostopic echo shows the data published on a topic.\n",

    "\n",

    "You probably won't see anything happen because no data is being published on the topic. Let's make turtle\\_teleop\\_key publish data by pressing the arrow keys. **Remember if the turtle isn't moving you need to select the turtle\\_teleop\\_key terminal again.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see the following when you press the up key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "linear: \n",
    "  x: 2.0\n",
    "  y: 0.0\n",

    "\n",
    "Communication on topics happens by sending ROS **messages** between nodes. For the publisher (turtle\\_teleop\\_key) and subscriber (turtlesim\\_node) to communicate, the publisher and subscriber must send and receive the same **type** of message.
